However, given that it's a vulnerability in a security product, we can infer that the complexity might be Low (L) as it could potentially be exploited with simple actions.\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability is in a security product, it's reasonable to assume that it requires Low (L) privileges to exploit, as the attacker might need to have some level of access to the system.\n\n- **User Interaction (UI)**: The description does not mention user interaction, so we cannot assign a specific value without further information. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume it requires User Interaction (R) since security vulnerabilities often require some form of user interaction to be fully exploited.\n\n- **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the entire product, so the scope is Unchanged (U).\n\n- **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive information, so the confidentiality impact is High (H).\n\n- **Integrity (I)**: The description does not mention any impact on data integrity, so we cannot assign a specific value without further information.\n\n- **Availability (A)**: The description does not mention any impact on availability, so we cannot assign a specific value without further information.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the CVSS v3.1 Base Score cannot be calculated accurately without specific values for Integrity (I) and Availability (A).

        "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the described CVE, we need to analyze the impact based on the provided description and the valid options for each metric. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The CVE description suggests that the vulnerability could be exploited through network interactions, as it involves a malicious BuildKit frontend or Dockerfile. Therefore, the Attack Vector is Network (N).\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity seems to be low (L) because the vulnerability can be exploited through simple actions like using a malicious BuildKit frontend or Dockerfile without requiring complex manipulation.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: This metric depends on the specific implementation details of the vulnerability, which are not fully detailed in the description. However, given the context, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker might require low privileges (L) to exploit the vulnerability, as it involves manipulating build artifacts.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description does not explicitly mention user interaction. However, considering the nature of the vulnerability, it's likely that user interaction (R) is required, especially if the exploit involves actions that need user input.\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability affects the build process, which could potentially impact the availability of the application or service. Given the description, it's more likely to be Changed (C) rather than Unchanged (U), as the exploitation could alter the build process's outcome.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to access or modify files on the host system, affecting confidentiality. Therefore, the Confidentiality impact is High (H).\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: Since the vulnerability allows for the modification of files, it directly impacts the integrity of the system. Thus, the Integrity impact is also High (H).\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability could potentially disrupt the availability of the application or service by affecting the build process. Therefore, the Availability impact is Low (L), assuming the exploitation does not directly cause a denial of service but rather",

The Ursa and AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations always generate a sufficient private key. A malicious issuer could in theory create a custom CL Signature implementation (derived from the Ursa or AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations) that uses weakened private keys such that presentations from holders could be shared by verifiers to the issuer who could determine the holder to which the credential was issued.

        "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the described CVE, we need to analyze the impact of the vulnerability based on the provided description and the valid options for each metric. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel, which is a widely used system software. This implies that the attack vector is likely to be Network (N) since the kernel operates at a system level and interacts with network stacks.\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions that the vulnerability involves a fix for a specific function (`efx_get_tx_queue()`) that is inappropriate for the given context. This suggests that the attack complexity is Low (L), as the attacker might not need to perform complex operations to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since the vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, it's reasonable to assume that it requires High (H) privileges to exploit, as kernel developers and administrators typically have elevated privileges.\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description does not mention any user interaction required to exploit the vulnerability, so we can assume that User Interaction (UI) is None (N).\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability is described as being resolved, which implies that it affects a specific component of the Linux kernel. This suggests that the scope is Unchanged (U), as the vulnerability does not affect the entire kernel but rather a specific part.\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability in the Linux kernel could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive information, affecting confidentiality. Therefore, we can consider Confidentiality (C) to be High (H).\n\n7. **Integrity (I)**: If the vulnerability allows unauthorized access, it could also lead to unauthorized modifications, affecting the integrity of the system. Thus, Integrity (I) can be considered High (H).\n\n8. **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability's impact on availability is not directly mentioned, but given that it's in the kernel, exploiting it could lead to denial of service (DoS",

Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are \"simple\" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3.

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.  Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all resources have been acquired which means that it can also be deregistered on probe deferrals.  In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver (or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to be deallocated.  When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a use-after-free when attaching the bridges:   dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)  which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:   [drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16  or a NULL-pointer dereference:   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000  ...  Call trace:    drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]    drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]    drm_bridge_attach+0x80/0x1a8 [drm]    dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]    msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]  The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to after all resources have been looked up.  Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see commit fbc35b45f9f6 (\"Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER\")).
