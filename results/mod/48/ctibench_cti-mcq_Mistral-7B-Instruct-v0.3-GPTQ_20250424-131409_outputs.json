The best direct defense against this tactic is to limit the number of failed login attempts (rate limiting) or to use account lockout policies (T1556.002).\n\nSince the question asks for a mitigation strategy, the best answer would be A) Implementing a strict password expiration policy, as it can help limit the potential damage from a brute force attack by forcing users to change their passwords before an attacker can successfully crack it.\n\nSo, the answer is A.",
