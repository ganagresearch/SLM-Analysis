A weakness in the Hyperledger AnonCreds specification that is not mitigated in the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations is that the Issuer does not publish a key correctness proof demonstrating that a generated private key is sufficient to meet the unlinkability guarantees of AnonCreds. The Ursa and AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations always generate a sufficient private key. A malicious issuer could in theory create a custom CL Signature implementation (derived from the Ursa or AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations) that uses weakened private keys such that presentations from holders could be shared by verifiers to the issuer who could determine the holder to which the credential was issued. This vulnerability could impact holders of AnonCreds credentials implemented using the CL-signature scheme in the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations of CL Signatures.

Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are \"simple\" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3.

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.  Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all resources have been acquired which means that it can also be deregistered on probe deferrals.  In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver (or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to be deallocated.  When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a use-after-free when attaching the bridges:   dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)  which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:   [drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16  or a NULL-pointer dereference:   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000  ...  Call trace:    drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]    drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]    drm_bridge_attach+0x80/0x1a8 [drm]    dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]    msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]  The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to after all resources have been looked up.  Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see commit fbc35b45f9f6 (\"Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER\")).

        "response": "Based on the provided CVE description, we can analyze the CVSS v3.1 Base Score by determining the values for each base metric:\n\n1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which implies that it can be exploited remotely. Therefore, the Attack Vector is Network (N).\n\n2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description does not mention any specific complexity in exploiting the vulnerability. Therefore, we can assume that the Attack Complexity is Low (L).\n\n3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which implies that it requires kernel-level privileges to exploit. Therefore, the Privileges Required is High (H).\n\n4. **User Interaction (UI)**: The description does not mention any specific user interaction required to exploit the vulnerability. Therefore, we can assume that the User Interaction is None (N).\n\n5. **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, which implies that it affects all systems running the kernel. Therefore, the Scope is Unchanged (U).\n\n6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability does not mention any specific confidentiality impact.
