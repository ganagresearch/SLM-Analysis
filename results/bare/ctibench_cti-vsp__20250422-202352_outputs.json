The Ursa and AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations always generate a sufficient private key. A malicious issuer could in theory create a custom CL Signature implementation (derived from the Ursa or AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations) that uses weakened private keys such that presentations from holders could be shared by verifiers to the issuer who could determine the holder to which the credential was issued. This vulnerability could impact holders of AnonCreds credentials implemented using the CL-signature scheme in the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations of CL Signatures.

Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are \"simple\" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3.

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.  Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all resources have been acquired which means that it can also be deregistered on probe deferrals.  In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver (or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to be deallocated.  When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a use-after-free when attaching the bridges:   dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)  which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:   [drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16  or a NULL-pointer dereference:   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000  ...

In this case, the fix is to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to after all resources have been looked up.  Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see commit fbc35b45f9f6 (\"Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER\")).

        "response": "To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, let's analyze the provided CVE description and determine the values for each base metric:\n\n1. Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) - Although the vulnerability is mentioned in the context of the Linux kernel, there's no clear indication that the attacker can exploit this remotely over a network. However, since the system is connected to a network, it's possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability if they have local access to the system, which would make the Attack Vector Local (L). But given the complexity of the exploit and the need for specific knowledge about the system, we can assume that it's not trivial for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability without local access, making the Attack Vector Network (N).\n\n2. Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) - The exploit requires a specific understanding of the Linux kernel, the DRM series, and the pmic_glink_altmode driver. It also involves a race condition and a use-after-free issue, which are not common vulnerabilities and require a certain level of expertise to exploit.\n\n3. Privileges Required (PR): High (H) - The attacker needs to have root or administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability, as they need to manipulate the Linux kernel.\n\n4. User Interaction (UI): None (N) - There's no indication that the user needs to take any action for the vulnerability to be exploited.\n\n5. Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability affects the kernel and the display subsystem, but it doesn't seem to affect other parts of the system or spread to other systems.\n\n6. Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are all High (H) - The vulnerability can lead to NULL-pointer dereferences, which can cause unpredictable behavior, data corruption, and system crashes, affecting the system's availability. It can also potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the system's display subsystem, affecting its integrity.
