CVE Description: Micronaut Framework is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language. Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are \"simple\" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3.

CVE Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free  A recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for \"transparent bridges\" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a use-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.  This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.  Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all resources have been acquired which means that it can also be deregistered on probe deferrals.  In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver (or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to be deallocated.  When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a use-after-free when attaching the bridges:   dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)  which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:   [drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16  or a NULL-pointer dereference:   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000  ...

In this case, the fix is to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to after all resources have been looked up.  Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see commit fbc35b45f9f6 (\"Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER\")).

This can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.\n\nCWE-ID: CWE-1097: Injection Vulnerability\n\nBrief Justification:\n\nThe molfiles.js file is responsible for parsing and rendering molfiles, which are molecular structures that can be used in molecular simulations. The file is vulnerable to XSS due to a lack of input validation. If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the molfiles.js file, they can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.\n\nThe CWE-1097 vulnerability is a type of input validation vulnerability, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a web application by providing malicious input. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.\n\nIn this case, the lack of input validation in the molfiles.js file allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.",
