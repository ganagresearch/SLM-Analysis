A few weeks ago, Jack Johnson - I'll just pretend to know who that is and I definitely own about twelve of his albums, honest - asked fans to take part in #HackedbyJohnson. The idea was that fans could direct message him their username and password, and he'd post a personalised message on their Twitter feed. It got a bit of attention at the time due to potential issues of legality and the notion that we shouldn't really encourage people to send others their logins voluntarily. What you might have missed, is that in the last few days another singer was doing the whole 'send me your login for a marketing gimmick' approach in the form of Sebastian Olzanski. Sebastian - who sports 375k followers on Twitter and has a rock solid fanbase on Youtube and the like - sent out the following tweet: tweet the #hackedbyseb many times & i'll post a lil video on your account & then log out! (not actually hacking u i promise). \u2014 sebastian olzanski (@sebtsb) September 11, 2016 One assumes he'd seen the Jack Johnson stunt, or maybe this is something young singers do all the time and Johnson saw them doing it, and decided it was definitely a very good idea. Regardless of who came up with it first, the stage was set for some Twitter takeover action.

The original post is from back before the blog evolved into the Microsoft Security Blog and was still called \u201cJeff Jones Security Blog\u201d. I\u2019m including the full original text below, but this guidance applies today to whatever PC you are running. I hope you enjoy and welcome any comments you might have here or on @MSFTSecurity. Best regards, Jeff Be Safer \u2013 Run as Standard User I do my work as standard user on Windows 7, just as I did with Windows Vista. It is not a burden. When I need to do an admin task, I put on my \u201cadmin\u201d hat by switching to my admin account specifically and doing my admin thing and then logging off. I don\u2019t browse, I don\u2019t download stuff, and beyond the first week or so when I set up a new machine, I don\u2019t really need to do it that often. I think it is a best practice. Combine it with the improvements in Win7 and IE8 and we\u2019ve come a long way from where we started... Here is a news story that provides some supporting evidence for my belief. (Dark Reading) Taking away the administrative rights from Microsoft Windows 7 users will lessen the risk posed by 90 percent of the critical Windows 7 vulnerabilities reported to date and 100 percent of the Microsoft Office vulnerabilities reported last year. It will also mitigate the risk of 94 percent of vulnerabilities reported in all versions of Internet Explorer in 2009 and 100 percent of the vulnerabilities reported in Internet Explorer 8 during the same time period. Finally, it will reduce the danger posed by 64 percent of all Microsoft vulnerabilities reported last year. These findings come from a study conducted by BeyondTrust, which perhaps unsurprisingly sells software that restricts administrative privileges. The company argues that companies need its software to protect themselves, particularly during the time between Microsoft\u2019s publication of vulnerability information and the application of Microsoft\u2019s fixes.",

A yield farming platform 'utilizing arbitrage to gain optimal yield with low risk' has gone AWOL. Site down, Twitter account deleted, no word from the team behind it explaining what happened. Worst of all, some $10 million worth of funds have been drained leading to accusations of rug-pulling. So what\u2019s gone wrong with rugs in the land of yield farming? Yield farming in DeFi (Decentralised Finance) Yield farming is a popular target for scams, as lots of money is dropped into new services with the hope of big payouts via passive income earnings further down the line. People do receive payouts, by the way. However, as the article notes, many projects are open source. This makes it easy for people with bad intentions to fire up a bogus service of their own, wait for funds to be pumped into it, and then vanish. This is, of course, not very good when it happens. Sadly, this is what may have happened in this case. What is a rug pull in cryptocurrency? A rug pull (or 'being rugged', as they call it in cryptocurrency circles) is not a fun experience. Someone creates an altcoin (any coin other than Bitcoin) on a DEX (decentralised exchange). They then spend some time hyping that token on as many platforms as possible. The more noise, the better: anything to attract potential users. As more people invest, the idea is that the token increases in value. The liquidity of the project goes up as a result. When hype is at its maximum and investors are running wild, the creators suddenly drain the pool of its funds and fade from existence. Anyone who bought into the project is left with worthless tokens. At this point, sites and services related to the scam token are scrubbed, and a lot of people are out of pocket. The rug is well and truly pulled. What\u2019s happened to Arbix? A project called Arbix Finance has indeed pulled its site and deleted its Twitter. Arbix was audited and approved by Certik in November, adding legitimacy to itself and a way to reassure users it is on the level. Here\u2019s an example press release in relation to certification of another cryptocurrency platform. Audits and certifications such as these are common in the DeFi space, so it\u2019s probably a bit disconcerting for users to see the rug pull happen despite such forms of approval. The audit history page for Arbix Finance currently reads as follows: 'Warning: This project has been confirmed to be a rugpull and is deemed high risk. Do not engage, or interact, with this project.' Where did the money go? The Certik Twitter feed is currently revealing pieces of its investigation into what\u2019s happened. It\u2019s quite likely there\u2019s more to come, so this isn\u2019t the full story at present, but here\u2019s the current timeline of events: Word of the rugpull first breaks. People are told to steer clear of interacting, because it\u2019s still possible to get tangled up in losing some more money: https://twitter.com/certikorg/status/1478178581993902080 Money invested by users (the missing $10m) is sent to a variety of addresses, with a big chunk of the missing funds dumped. https://twitter.com/certikorg/status/1478243729244839938 That thread and offshoots of it are still being updated, so if you\u2019re impacted you\u2019ll want to bookmark for future reference.

The threat known as Dyre was originally spotted by security firm CSIS and by PhishMe which also had uncovered the new malware earlier in June. Back then, the threat was aimed at banks and other financial institutions, something very reminiscent of other banking Trojans such as Zeus and its variants. But researchers discovered that the malware is now capable of capturing login credentials from Salesforce users by redirecting them through a phishing website. Dyre will initially infect users through some form of social-engineering, typically with an email that contains a malicious attachment. Once on the system, the malware can act as a man-in-the-middle and intercept every single keystroke. To be clear, this is not a vulnerability with Salesforce or its website, but rather a type of malware that leverages compromised end-point machines. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware detecting the Dyre malware (click to enlarge). This type of attack could mean there might be a new trend on the horizon, one that goes after Software as a Service (SaaS) users. Businesses increasingly rely on third-party software providers for their needs because it can be a cheaper option without all the headaches of doing it yourself. For example, instead of managing their own email server, companies will use Office365 or similar cloud-based email solutions. Banking credentials are still the bread-and-butter for the majority of cyber-crooks because they can be immediately used. But the data harvested from many SaaS applications also holds a tremendous value for those willing to invest the time to dig in and find bits of information that could lead to a large compromise in a top-tier business. There is no silver bullet to defend against these threats but once again a healthy balance of end-user education about phishing scams and proper end-point security solutions will go a long way. Data exfiltration is one the most important issues of 2014 with a growing number of businesses being affected. The effects on companies' brands and trust of their customers can be very damaging and long lasting, not to mention the potential lawsuits that often follow. @jeromesegura",

[sic]: [gallery type='slideshow' ids='7907,7908'] The problem was that the popups would never actually stop from harassing you no matter how many times you clicked on the 'OK' button. This was triggered by an advert that was delivered by wwbads via Google's DoubleClick and Adtech (AOL's ad serving platform). The advertiser wwbads appears to be serving normal ads but every once in a while, switches to the pop up one: [youtube=http://youtu.be/1sM2fRf8R1E&rel=0] This is cause for concern, not only because the publisher (salon.com) would certainly not appreciate subjecting their visitors to such nagging messages but also because the script itself could be anything, including something malicious. The term 'payload' is also often referred to as malware, at least in the security industry. It is entirely possible that the advertiser was 'testing' out something new, but even if that were the case, you simply cannot do that in a live production environment. Another possibility is that the advertiser's platform has been hacked and actual bad guys are fooling around with it. Looking back in time, the site did once suffer a defacement: We contacted the advertiser but they did not immediately respond to our email. We also informed AOL's Adtech and Google's DoubleClick as they ought to know about this kind of activity. Adtech responded to us pretty quickly to let us know that it was an account from one of their demand-side platform users and that it had been disabled.

In the spirit of better late than never, though, here are my top Security Predictions for the year, in no particular order: The Security Industry will continue to grow, with several small new companies becoming more relevant to existing and emerging security problems. This trend will be reinforced by folks wanting to benefit and cash in on another continuing trend, namely: Security Company Consolidation will continue, with the major companies continuing to acquire interesting smaller technology companies to get both the technology and expertise needed to be competitive. More Enterprise Linux vulnerabilities will be patched than for all supported Windows platforms combined. This is a lay up, since it has been true for a couple of years now. NAP/NAC will prove itself to NOT be like PKI. Basically, I think NAC/NAP will have some substantial success stories during 2007 and adoption will be quicker than some people have predicted, driven by the interoperation of the NAP agent in Windows Vista with the Cisco NAC capability. Mac OS X Vulnerability Disclosures will continue to grow, resulting in more pressure on Apple to take security seriously and institute some rigor around both their development and security response processes. Windows Vista security improvements will become demonstrable as the ASLR, DEP, Service Hardening and other layers of protection combine with SDL-improved security quality to reduce the number and severity of vulnerabilities disclosed and fixed. Impact from Targeted Attacks eclipse Malware Impact. The established industry around identity theft, combined with new laws requiring disclosure of successful attacks will bring more attention to targeted attacks and heighten security awareness concerning targeted attacks. Ubuntu Maintains Subscription-Free Patching Model. In an effort to make inroads into Red Hat and Novell dominance for Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu will continue to offer a subscription-free access to patches for their \u201cLong Term Support\u201d versions during 2007. While I expect that they will eventually follow Red Hat\u2019s example and use entitlement enforcement for subscriptions, I think that change is a year or two away. Continued Focus on Popular Applications. The trend will show that security researchers continue a push \u201cupstack\u201d on applications. Additionally, more malware will be focused on popular applications such as instant messaging, Internet telephony and consumer music applications. Linux Vendors Announce Major Lifecycle Changes. As the combination of Enterprise Support commitments intersect with short release cycles, 2007 will see Red Hat developing and releasing security patches for RHEL2.1, RHEL3, RHEL4 and RHEL5 (Workstation, Enterprise Server, Advanced Server, etc) for the hundreds of packages under support. RHEL5 will likely drive a surge of Security Advisories similar to the release of RHEL4, causing a serious burden to the security response team. I consider the most likely possibility to be that release cycles will be quietly lengthened, but other options, such as an early end-of-life for RHEL2.1 could help alleviate the burden as well. Other vendors face similar challenges, so the change could come from any of the ones offering Enterprise Support commitments. World of Warcraft Implements Security Upgrade. With an unprecedented 8 Million subscribers, the World of Warcraft money machine has even more reason than ever to protect the internal economy and player\u2019s experience. After considering many options, WoW will likely go with software-based authentication upgrade due to the higher costs of buying and distributing hardware tokens.",

I was part of a team planning an official visit by HRH Princess Anne to open a new multi-million pound research laboratory. We thought it would be nice to assign roles to some of the people working in the new facility. One chap in particular, a renowned doctor of science no less, was given the task of opening a door for Her Royal Highness. That\u2019s it, just open the door for her to pass through. Come the big day, Princess Anne made her way down the hallway, got to the doctor and his door, which he opened perfectly. She paused and said to the chap \u201cand what do you do?\u201d Utterly flustered, all he could manage by way of reply was: \u201cEr, um, er. I open the doors.\u201d She smiled and moved on. He never lived the moment down. That\u2019s a rather convoluted way of introducing a new series of personal profiles about people who work on Trustworthy Computing, within a division of the same name. As you may know, Trustworthy Computing (TwC) was formed 10 years ago last month. We\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve achieved over the last decade, but know we have much more yet to do. We thought it would be fun to take a look at some of the people in TwC and what they do both in and out of work. Over the next few weeks from time to time we\u2019ll be posting 30 second profiles on some of our people. The first is on Adrienne Hall, TwC general manager and a regular blogger on this site. \u2013 What do you do in TwC and how long have you been doing it? For the last four years I\u2019ve been leading a team focused on helping organizations keep their networks secure and helping individuals stay safe, secure and private on the internet. A key area of focus for me right now is the cloud and what we are doing to make it secure, private and reliable for our customers. \u2013 What\u2019s the first thing you do every day at work? Sit down with a soy latte to scan the news headlines and read news coverage. \u2013 What is the biggest security challenge facing the industry? Push me for only one and I\u2019d have to say machines and devices that do not routinely apply security updates. Effective updating discipline is a fundamental yet critical defense against cybercriminals. \u2013 What\u2019s the biggest contribution you or your team has achieved in the last 10 years? Predictable and clear communication regarding monthly security bulletins so that customers know how to protect themselves. It is also rewarding to see people increasingly acknowledge Microsoft as a leader in protecting the security and privacy of customer systems and information, and in providing world-class security intelligence. \u2013 What do you do to unwind? I love to switch my Windows Phone off, power down my laptop and watch some classic period drama TV. My favorite right now is Downton Abbey. \u2013 Favorite band? I\u2019m a huge U2 fan, especially their early work.

This issue is the same as one we reported almost two years ago. Many .gov websites have open redirections that can be exploited by spammers. The example we detailed in February 2011 is actually still online, and so is the cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that we found on the same page. How did we get there? Many websites want to warn users when they are leaving their domains. In the case of a .gov website, they want to make clear that an external domain does not carry the guarantee of being an official government website. This warning is supposed to add security for end users. Facebook also uses a warning page because links can be added by anybody and Facebook cannot guarantee the safety of those URLs. Why are these warning being exploited? Spammers want clean URLs to bypass URL filters and spam filters. They therefore use legitimate .gov websites to bypass security features. This warning may actually make the final URL look safer to the user by implying that the final URL has been linked and vetted, by the .gov website. In the case of www.fmcsa.dot.gov (see our previous post), the user has only 10 seconds to read the warning before being redirected automatically. That's great for the spammer as no additional click is required to redirect the user to the spam/scam site. These websites owners think they are adding additional security, but this decision is actually putting their users at risk. The assumption that leads to the abuse of open redirections is that the user seeing the warning has clicked on an external link on a page from the same .gov domain. Since the content on the .gov website is controlled, the external link has to be a safe link. The website creators did not think of spammers sending users directly to the warning page. The fix The fix is actually easy - make sure the assumption is right. This means the warning page should make sure that the redirection is legitimate - that the URL is one that has been approved. There are a couple of way of ensuring that the redirection URL has been controlled: Referrer One way, not the most robust option, is to check the Referrer header to ensure the user comes from the same domain. This would stop user who clicked on a link in an e-mail, and spammers who use URL shorteners like bit.ly. Allowlist Another option is to store all 3rd-party URLs in an allowlist, and check against the list before making any redirection. This would prevent anybody from using the redirection with arbitrary URLs. The main downside to this approach is the overhead to manage this list every time an external URL is added or removed from the website. Hash The most common solution is to sign the URL. For example, replace http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/redirect.asp?page=https://www.zscaler.com/ with http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/redirect.asp?page=https://www.zscaler.com/&hash=THE_HASH where THE_HASH = hash('https://www.zscaler.com' + secret). The URL is hashed with a secret key to prevent its replacement by a random address. This method is used by Facebook to guarantee the authenticity requests sent by Facebook to Facebook applications, for example. The important takeaway for all webmasters is to understand that spammers will take advantage of any flaw in web applications. Be very careful with the assumptions you make.

When it finally does, a few unfamiliar applications litter your desktop, and your browser immediately sends you to an ad for hair loss products. Sounds like your PC has a problem with malware. So what should you do? Before you flip out, try these simple steps to clean up your infected computer. 1. Computer acting suspect? Do a little digging and check for symptoms. Look for issues characteristic of a malware infection: Does your web browser freeze or become unresponsive? Do you get redirected to web pages other than the ones you are trying to visit? Are you bombarded with pop-up messages? Does your computer run slower than usual? Do you see new icons on your desktop that you don\u2019t recognize? Are your fans spinning suspiciously louder or harder than usual? Unfortunately, even if you see nothing wrong with your computer, there may be trouble brewing under the surface, sneaking around and screwing with your files undetected. So it's a safe bet to move on to Step 2 even if you can't find a symptom. 2. Use protection: Enter safe mode. Remove CDs and DVDs, and unplug USB drives from your computer. Then shut down. When you restart, press the F8 key repeatedly. This should bring up the Advanced Boot Options menu. Select Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter. Only the bare minimum programs and services are used in this mode. If any malware is programmed to automatically load when Windows starts, entering safe mode may block the attempt. 3. Back up your files. This includes documents, photos, and videos. Especially cat videos. Do not back up program files, as those are where infections like to hide. You can always download these programs again if files are lost. 4. Download an on-demand malware scanner such as Malwarebytes. If you had no trouble connecting to the Internet before you suspected the infection, you can leave Safe Mode after having backed up your files and return to using your 'normal' system. If your Internet was jammed up by a suspected infection, try using a friend's computer to download your scanner and move it to your machine using a USB drive. Follow set-up instructions and install the program. 5. Run the scan. If you truly believe you are infected, do not pass go, do not collect $100. Just go directly to the scan. If you do have an infection, your on-demand scanner should let you know that you in danger, girl. A list of scan results tells you what malware was found and removed. Some cybersecurity software also flags potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and puts them in the corner with Baby. If you'd like to keep a program your malware scanner deems is suspect, you can add it to an exclusions list and go about your day. 6. Restart your computer. After all, everyone deserves a second chance. 7. Confirm the results of your anti-malware scan by running a full scan with another malware detection program. You can try a program such as AdwCleaner, which targets PUPs and adware (those obnoxious pop-ups littering your browser). Restart again if the program found additional infections. 8. Update your operating system, browser, and applications. If there\u2019s an update available on any of your software, go ahead and do it. Some of the most dangerous forms of malware are delivered by exploits that take advantage of out-of-date software. 9. Reset all of your passwords. Before being deleted, malware could have captured your passwords and forwarded them to criminals. Change each and every password you can think of, and make sure they\u2019re strong. None of this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 business. That\u2019s the combination an idiot would use on his luggage. 10.

If you had no trouble connecting to the Internet before you suspected the infection, you can leave Safe Mode after having backed up your files and return to using your 'normal' system. If your Internet was jammed up by a suspected infection, try using a friend's computer to download your scanner and move it to your machine using a USB drive. Follow set-up instructions and install the program. 5. Run the scan. If you truly believe you are infected, do not pass go, do not collect $100. Just go directly to the scan. If you do have an infection, your on-demand scanner should let you know that you in danger, girl. A list of scan results tells you what malware was found and removed. Some cybersecurity software also flags potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and puts them in the corner with Baby. If you'd like to keep a program your malware scanner deems is suspect, you can add it to an exclusions list and go about your day. 6. Restart your computer. After all, everyone deserves a second chance. 7. Confirm the results of your anti-malware scan by running a full scan with another malware detection program. You can try a program such as AdwCleaner, which targets PUPs and adware (those obnoxious pop-ups littering your browser). Restart again if the program found additional infections. 8. Update your operating system, browser, and applications. If there\u2019s an update available on any of your software, go ahead and do it. Some of the most dangerous forms of malware are delivered by exploits that take advantage of out-of-date software. 9. Reset all of your passwords. Before being deleted, malware could have captured your passwords and forwarded them to criminals. Change each and every password you can think of, and make sure they\u2019re strong. None of this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 business. That\u2019s the combination an idiot would use on his luggage. 10. If, after all of these steps, you\u2019re still having problems with a possible infection, feel free to post your question in our public forum. And if you want your Mac, iPhone, or Android phone as shiny and new as your PC after a cleaning, you can run anti-malware scans on these devices as well.",

When it finally does, a few unfamiliar applications litter your desktop, and your browser immediately sends you to an ad for hair loss products. Sounds like your PC has a problem with malware. So what should you do? Before you flip out, try these simple steps to clean up your infected computer. 1. Computer acting suspect? Do a little digging and check for symptoms. Look for issues characteristic of a malware infection: Does your web browser freeze or become unresponsive? Do you get redirected to web pages other than the ones you are trying to visit? Are you bombarded with pop-up messages? Does your computer run slower than usual? Do you see new icons on your desktop that you don\u2019t recognize? Are your fans spinning suspiciously louder or harder than usual? Unfortunately, even if you see nothing wrong with your computer, there may be trouble brewing under the surface, sneaking around and screwing with your files undetected. So it's a safe bet to move on to Step 2 even if you can't find a symptom. 2. Use protection: Enter safe mode. Remove CDs and DVDs, and unplug USB drives from your computer. Then shut down. When you restart, press the F8 key repeatedly. This should bring up the Advanced Boot Options menu. Select Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter. Only the bare minimum programs and services are used in this mode. If any malware is programmed to automatically load when Windows starts, entering safe mode may block the attempt. 3. Back up your files. This includes documents, photos, and videos. Especially cat videos. Do not back up program files, as those are where infections like to hide. You can always download these programs again if files are lost. 4. Download an on-demand malware scanner such as Malwarebytes.
