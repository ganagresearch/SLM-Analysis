This CWE is applicable because the vulnerability involves a stack-based buffer overflow, which occurs when data is written outside the bounds of a buffer, leading to potential execution of malicious code. The vulnerability arises from improper validation of the InitialMacroLen field in the DPS file parsing process, allowing an attacker to exploit this flaw by crafting a DPS file that, when opened by a user, can lead to remote code execution.", "predicted_answer": "CWE-120", "ground_truth": "CWE-120", "is_correct": true, "status": "Evaluated"}
{"item_id": "index_94", "model_response_raw": "The CVE description provided corresponds to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This type of vulnerability is typically associated with CWE-79, which is the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ID for Cross-Site Scripting. The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, which is the core characteristic of XSS attacks.\n\n\nCWE ID: CWE-79", "predicted_answer": "CWE-79", "ground_truth": "CWE-79", "is_correct": true, "status": "Evaluated"}

This can lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users. This falls under the category of improper neutralization of input during web page generation, as the plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it on the page.", "predicted_answer": "CWE-79", "ground_truth": "CWE-79", "is_correct": true, "status": "Evaluated"}
